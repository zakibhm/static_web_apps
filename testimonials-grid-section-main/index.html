        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never wirtten a line of code. I needed some structure form the professionals who can help me learnn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance, The agile tream project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact I,ve often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommend! "
